-Hi, I'm Mohammad Sajeed Habibi , a web developer and UI/UX designer. I have been working as a web and software developer for the past 3 years, mainly focused on web technologies and UI/UX design.

I love programming, design, user interfaces, and open-source, and that's what I'm passionate about. Aside from work, I'm a big fan of  cricket and cycling.

Currently, I'm working on a few tools for developers to be launched in the near future. In addition, I'm learning flutter to make cross-platform apps and blockchain development.
